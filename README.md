Project Description

The idea and approach of this project is quite simple yet it is going to be very useful to the population. “Education is the key to success”, it is a popular proverb and the reason for all of us participating in the competition of this world. Education is the most important part of life and everyone has the equal right over education. The program like digital education is highly prevalent nowadays and it is one of the most popular ways to provide education globally.
The situation now, turning worse day by day is alarming for the shift of the education policies totally online and creating a holistic environment while sitting back at home.
We the Team “Indees” present you with the most advance e-learning platform, “Indees Edu Hub” where learning has an entirely new point of view. Our team has developed this website where teachers and students can join this website and start with the sessions. The website is fully featuring rich including all the most advance features in it.
The services used in this website are mostly from the parent company of Microsoft. Introducing the website the first tab is the Home tab itself where the website logs in when you click on this link. Resume’s tab can be used for viewing the resume that you can build using the Resume Builder tab in this website. The next tab is the Study with AR, this tab is one of the most advance use of technology you will find in an educational website. We have used spatial anchors from Microsoft azure services and built an Android app which is going to help the students using Augmented Reality. So this is what makes learning easy and fun. This tab basically will redirect you to download and install this Android application on your device. The next tab we have is the Quiz tab, here students can test their skills without even signing into the website. So the quiz section allows you to test your knowledge based on your class on different subjects. You can also create your own account to check and save your progress. In the my Account section you can see the dashboard and the courses you are going through as well as you can give a look to your profile too.
When you are signing up in the website, you can join as a teacher or as a student. When you join as a teacher you are given the option to create your own class and the classes uploaded by you will be directly available on our portal, so the students can easily access the learning sessions assigned by you.
Finally we have the About Us and the Contact Us tab, where you will get to know about the team “Indees” and the “Indees Edu Hub”. But definitely the website is not the precise model due to the lack of financial strength, but we assured to provide a finished product with proper amenities and financial power.
